Step 1: Install Arduino IDE & Packages

1️⃣ Download Arduino IDE

Go to: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Choose your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) and install.

2️⃣ Connect Arduino Uno :-
Plug your Arduino Uno into your computer via USB cable.
In Arduino IDE:
--> Go to Tools → Board → Arduino AVR Boards → Arduino Uno
--> Go to Tools → Port → Select the COM Port (usually COM3 or above for Windows, /dev/ttyUSBx for Linux).

3️⃣ Install Required Libraries :- 
Default Projects: No extra library needed.
Advanced Projects: Use Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries to install needed ones.

For example:
--> DHT sensor library by Adafruit (for DHT11/DHT22 sensors)
--> LiquidCrystal (for LCD displays, comes pre-installed)
--> MQUnifiedsensor (for MQ gas sensors)
--> ESP8266WiFi (if using WiFi module)
